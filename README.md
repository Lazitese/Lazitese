## About

I’m a builder-first full-stack engineer who enjoys turning real problems into clean, usable software.

My work focuses on:
- Production-ready web applications
- AI-integrated products
- High-quality UI and smooth user experiences
- Practical systems that are easy to maintain and evolve

I value correctness, simplicity, and shipping software that actually works.
