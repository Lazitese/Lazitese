## About

I’m a builder-first engineer who enjoys turning complex ideas into clean, usable products.

My work focuses on:
- Production-ready web applications
- AI-integrated products
- High-quality UI and smooth user experience
- Systems that are simple to use and practical to maintain

I care more about **how things work** than how loudly they’re marketed.
